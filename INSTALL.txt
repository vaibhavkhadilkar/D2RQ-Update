D2RQ-Update INSTALL
====================

D2RQ-Update is an extension to the D2RQ platform. It includes the ability to add and remove data from the underlying relational database. A Jena RDB model is used to temporarily house the data that cannot be inserted into the database. This extension also provides the ability to arbitrarily construct blank nodes as combinations of underlying relational database columns.
 
To use this software all the .jar files under lib/ must be on the classpath and must be available to your application.

Also use the "create-d2rq-patch" target from the build.xml file to create a patch and place this patch on the classpath.
 
D2RQ-Update is tested with these .jar files.
