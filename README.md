## D2RQ-Update

D2RQ-Update is an extension to the D2RQ platform. It includes the ability to add and remove data from the underlying relational database. A Jena RDB model is used to temporarily house the data that cannot be inserted into the database. This extension also provides the ability to arbitrarily construct blank nodes as combinations of underlying relational database columns.
